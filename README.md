## Overview

Hi All!

One of my favorite movies growing up was Toy Story. My objective was to practice using HTML, CSS, and Javascript by making a project that was meaningful to me. 
So, I decided to make an etch-a-sketch program by recreating a piece of nostalgia from Toy Story! 

I hope you enjoy!
